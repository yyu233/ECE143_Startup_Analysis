"""#Keytake Aways


1.   If the founders had exposure across the globe, it increased the success rate of the startup by a lot.
2.   If the founder had relevance to venture, then the startupâ€™s success rate increases a lot. Almost 83% of all successful startup founders had previous experience in venture capital.
3. If the founders have already a prior experience in selling and building products, the chances of these startups succeeding increases a lot.
